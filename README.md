## Installation

The script `setup.sh` should be enough to make symbolic links and install required
dependencies. However, some dependencies should be manually installed. Make sure you
have installed: curl, npm, git, bundler, exuberant-ctags. It is tested in both
linux(Ubuntu 12.10, 13.04) and OSX(Lion and Mountain Lion).

## Plugins

The most important plugins I use are:

* [NeoBundle] - package manager based on [Vundle] but way better in features and support.
* [unimpaired.vim] - many useful mappings for back and forth operations
* [surround.vim] - modify surrounding delimiters with a single keystroke
* [repeat.vim] - add repeat funcionality with `.` command for many of Tim Pope's
  plugins
* [dispatch.vim] - from within vim, run many shell commands with assynchronous
  support
* [endwise.vim] - closes blocks like `if`, `for` automagically
* [abolish.vim] - abolish typos with a smart abbreviation schema and some other
  cool features
* [vim-css-color] - highlight colors written in css files
* [NerdCommenter] - easily comment and uncomment lines, blocks, etc.
* [ctrlp.vim] - fucking killer command to open files
* [ctrlp-modified.vim] - ctrlp.vim extension to open files modified since last commit
  and since branch creation
* [Tagbar] - adds a nice bar based on the tags for the current file.
* [vim-snippets] - snippets repository for many languages for both [Snipmate],
  UltiSnip Snippets and [NeoSnippet]. Currently, I help maintaining Ruby and Elixir snippets.
* [NeoSnippet] - snippets engine
* [delimitMate] - auto close of `()`, `[]`, `{}`
* [vim-powerline] - beatiful and useful status line. It's going to be deprecated
  in favor of a [new version][new powerline]. I'm sticking to the old one until that.
* [scala-vim-support] - scala indentation and syntax highlight
* [gundo.vim] - fucking awesome way to not loose nothing while undoing things
* [Syntastic] - syntactic rules for many languages
* [vim-textobj-user] - helps you define custom [text objects]
* [CamelCaseMotion] - move between camel case and snake case words
* [vim-tags] - easily generate ctags from within Vim
* [xml.vim] - some goodies for our beloved xml editting
* [vim-visual-star-search] - fix strange behaviour for `*` in visual mode
* [Travis CI Vim] - plugin that I created for Travis CI build browsing
* [SwapIt] - improves Vim `<C-A>` and `<C-X>` to work on words like `yes`,
  `no`, `true`, `false` and some others
* [vim-instant-markdown] - automatically preview markdown edited within Vim
* [rizzatti/dash.vim] - add Vim support for OSX Dash app
* [fugitive.vim] - cool git wrapper
* [gitv] - [fugitive.vim] extension to view git logs beautifully
* [vim-gitgutter] - adds nice signs warning about file modifications in a git
  tracked repository
* [textobj-gitgutter] - creates text objects related to Vim Git Gutter hunks(`ih`, `ah`)
* [gist-vim] - creates, lists, reads, edits gists from within Vim
* [vim-ruby] - helps editing Ruby source code
* [vim-ruby-refactoring] - helps ruby code refactor
* [rails.vim] - adds syntax highlight and helps editing Rails apps
* [vim-textobj-rubyblock] - creates Vim text objects for ruby code(`ir`, `ar`).
  Also lets you use `%` to move between `do .. end`, `if .. end` and other paired
  ruby keywords

## Organization

This repository is organized in such a way to avoid what I call .vimrc hell. I created
it based on a [friend's vim files](https://github.com/jvortmann/vim-files).

### General settings

All editor settings are place in `conf` directory. General settings are placed in
`conf/autocmd.vim` and `conf/defaults.vim`. Shortcuts that are plugin independent
are placed in `conf/shortcuts.vim` file.

### Plugin settings

Each plugin has its entry in `conf/bundles.vim` file. This file is going to be
used by [NeoBundle] install/enable the plugins. Plugins that need custom settings
have a file with its name in `plugin` directory. All shortcuts plugins, plugin
variables will be placed there. Vim automatically loads all these files when it
is starting up.
